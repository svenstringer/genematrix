# Introduction

The GeneMatrix package is designed to create an annotated gene table based on Gencode gene definitions, with a focus  on brain-related information. Gene definitions are based on Gencode, matched with entrez genes and the official HGNC gene names to create a core matrix. This preprocessed and filtered core matrix includes the final genes that can be annotated with third-party information. Currently the following annotations can be included:

* Exac pLI constraint scores for all exac subjects and subjects without a psychiatric disorder.
* Brain Expression levels and diffrential expression SCZ vs controls in PLFC based on Common Mind data.
* Gwas catalog hits
* OMIM associations
* Gene-based p-values for several brain-related phenotypes

The package was developed in R version 3.3.1 and currently only is compatible with linux.

# Installation

The GeneMatrix R package is available on [Github](https://github.com/svenstringer/genematrix).

# Quickly creating the default Gene Matrix

To create a default gene matrix, run the following code in R:

>generate_genematrix()

The first run may take up to an hour. Future runs will be much quicker due to cached third-party resources and cached intermediate results.
# Creating a custom gene-matrix in steps

While `generate_genematrix()` runs through all steps to create a default GeneMatrix, it is possible to complete the intermediate steps manually. 

## Core gene matrix

Before adding third-party gene annotations. A core matrix with gene (defnitions) needs to be created.

This can be done with

>core <- get_core_matrix()

The creation of this core gene matrix involves several steps.



## Exac pLI constraint scores

## Brain expression

The brain expression 

## GWAS catalog hits

## OMIM associations

## Gene-based p-values

It is possible to add gene-based p-values for any phenotype as long as summary statistics are available for each phenotype in a specific format in a specified folder.
