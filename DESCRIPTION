Description: The GeneMatrix package is designed to create an annotated
    gene table based on Gencode gene definitions, with a focus on brain-related
    information. Gene definitions are based on Gencode, matched with entrez genes
    and the official HGNC gene names to create a core matrix. This preprocessed and
    filtered core matrix includes the final genes that can be annotated with third-
    party information. Currently the following annotations can be included: Exac
    pLI constraint scores for all exac subjects and subjects without a psychiatric
    disorder, Brain Expression levels and diffrential expression SCZ vs controls in
    PLFC based on Common Mind data, Gwas catalog hits, OMIM associations, Gene-based
    p-values for several brain-related phenotypes. This software is created in collaboration with Patrick Sullivan.
